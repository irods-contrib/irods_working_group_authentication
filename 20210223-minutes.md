## Minutes

### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - Can a client (Metalnx) remove its rodsadmin requirement?
   - Yes, Auth should not require proxy privileges
   - As it moves towards a REST-client model, the proxy/admin work is done in the REST layer, not in the client itself
 - Utrecht - Web portal working with OIDC
   - Still working on iCommands and WebDAV
   - Mostly UX decisions, passing tokens around, URI really long
 - Still need to investigate Keycloak (Consortium)
 - Martin using Keycloak already, using with microservice
