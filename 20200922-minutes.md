### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - Discussed last month's update and progress
 - SURF still have a couple open questions on the client side
   - working - stored JSON on client side, set of responses from IDP/PAM service, allow reuse with the iRODS service until it times out itself… but if expired token, then re-authenticate via PAM
   - No encryption of the token on client side… yet
 - Possible single-signout / logout
   - How to disable/invalidate existing tokens
   - May be protocol-dependent
   - Should it be 'iexit' that does this?  Some other operation/endpoint?
   - Is there ever a use case for leaving the temporary password in the iRODS table… no, safer to always get rid of it - force them to reauthenticate anyhow.
 - Eventually/Now - move to JWTs for all tokens we handle inhouse
   - Would replace the current temporary passwords / .irodsA files
   - Already encrypted on the client, well-supported by existing libraries
   - Are we just recreating keycloak?  (or punt to it?)
 - Nice intro to OAuth2 and OIDC - https://youtu.be/996OiexHze0 
 - Possible move SURF external PAM handshake service to set of iRODS microservices that can be called from the server-side auth plugin - and this removes the need for the external software.
   - Use blackboard pattern - shared state
   - https://github.com/irods/irods/blob/master/lib/core/include/experimental_plugin_framework.hpp#L169
 - Want to make sure all the icommands can pick up and retry on an expired token
   - getenv() should be able to return the name of the requesting client (icp/iput, etc)
   - Can store this in the shared state, send it back to the server
 - Investigate going all in on keycloak
   - No new code!
