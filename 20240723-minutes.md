### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - pam_interactive
   - Account spoofing PR now merged
     - https://github.com/irods/irods_auth_plugin_pam_interactive/issues/18
     - https://github.com/irods/irods_auth_plugin_pam_interactive/pull/19
   - Noticed responses are being recorded into `.irods/.irodsA.json` file
     - Including plaintext password
     - New PR only saving the expire time, generated from the plugin
       - If client thinks it's still valid, but the server says no
         - Then it will still 'fail'
       - Only a 'shortcut/hint' for the client to 'skip' a new auth attempt
     - What breaks by NOT saving the password?
     - Why did we ever write that down?
     - Persistent client information
     - Page 6 of https://irods.org/uploads/2022/Wolfsheimer-Cacciari-SURF-Programmable_authentication_workflows_in_iRODS-paper.pdf
   - Should we provide configuration / switch to NOT save user responses?
     - Need a prefix/suffix or flag to 'save' this value for each challenge/response
       - '_save' or 'save_' or...
       - Pam interactive will store the key/values that include the prefix/suffix in the key
       - 'Patch' is a list of operations coming from the pam module
         - path/value... so the path would be checked for the prefix/suffix
       - But pam module doesn't have 'path'... just the prompt.  Only has ECHO_ON and ECHO_OFF... and we can key on that perhaps...
         - If ECHO_OFF, then we should NOT write it down on client
   - Suggestion... for first release
     - Let's not write anything down on client side except 'expire'
     - If/when use case appears...
       - we can move to ECHO_ON as flag/signal to save on client side
   - Why '__expire__' rather than just 'expire' or 'expiration_time'?
     - Special to plugin for some reason?  'Internal'?  Namespacing...
   - `server_config.json` has some pam_interactive messages/values
     - 4.3.x have started using R_GRID_CONFIGURATION in the database
     - Should we move pam_interactive configs into database as well?
       - Seems good to have zone-wide consistency
       - We already have the APIs for the server/plugin to get/set these
   - Pam interactive has special logic to inspect JSON from pam module
     - If prompt only, does not write it down (see page 6 of pdf above)
     - If 'patch', then it records locally
     - Currently, pam_unix sends NOT JSON, and plugin just defaults to write down the response... perhaps we should change this default to NOT write it down?
   - Alan paste...
   - We "patch state" based on the presence of these keys in the pstate JSON structure: https://github.com/irods/irods_auth_plugin_pam_interactive/blob/04bbf5b6e4ba84ee5471c15bcc6a1b1585a7baf9/plugin/src/main.cpp#L134-L149
   - And here is where we construct the patch for cases where the module does not return JSON: https://github.com/irods/irods_auth_plugin_pam_interactive/blob/04bbf5b6e4ba84ee5471c15bcc6a1b1585a7baf9/plugin/src/main.cpp#L634-L662
   - And here's how we write down the pstate to the file, which had all of those values unpacked into it in patch_state(): https://github.com/irods/irods_auth_plugin_pam_interactive/blob/04bbf5b6e4ba84ee5471c15bcc6a1b1585a7baf9/plugin/src/main.cpp#L440-L454
   - From page 4 of pdf

   - Three configurations
      - pam_module somewhere, up to the administrators
      - iRODS now using database-saved R_GRID_CONFIGURATION
      - pam_interactive had its own in server_config...
         - but now should honor the grid config
         - Need to confirm we can ignore/remove this config
         - ignore/delete for now, and add it back with a known use case?
         - https://docs.irods.org/4.3.2/system_overview/configuration/#authentication-configuration
 - OIDC/OAuth2 in HTTP API
   - User mapping update
     - Need plugin interface and initial implementation
     - Looking at C API rather than C++
   - JWT verification
   - Take access token scopes into consideration
 - Next Meeting
   - August 2024

### SURF example code:

# irods_auth_plugin_pam_interactive


## Installation


1. Install iRODS 4.2.7 or 4.2.8 for CentOS


2. Install yum-plugin-priorities


```
yum install yum-plugin-priorities
```
(see https://wiki.centos.org/PackageManagement/Yum/Priorities)


3. Configure surf yum repository
```
sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/surf-irods.repo
```

gpgcheck=0
priority=90
#Optional - if you have GPG signing keys installed, use the below flags to verify the repository metadata signature:
#gpgkey=artie.ia.surfsara.nl/artifactory/DMS-RPM-Testing-Public/7/irods-4.2.7/master/repomd.xml.key
#repo_gpgcheck=1
```

## Usage and configuration

The auth plugin can handle conversations with an arbitrary list of challenges driven by the PAM stack.
Users can trigger a conversation from a icommand (e.g. iinit). The backend sends messages / challenges to the client and recieves
responses. The workflow can be dynamically branched.


### Simple workflow
By default the user's responses are stored locally after sucessful authentication. These responses are used as default values for further
workflows. In a typical case, the user uses iinit to interactively communicate with the backend, while other icommands use the stored
responses.


#### Example
*/etc/pam.d/irods*
```bash
auth required pam_python.so /etc/pam.d/irods.py
```
*/etc/pam.d/irods.py*
```python
def pam_sm_authenticate(pamh, flags, argv):
   pamh.conversation(pamh.Message(pamh.PAM_TEXT_INFO, "Hello"))
   msg = pamh.conversation(pamh.Message(pamh.PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON, "type 'more' if you want more:"))
   response= msg.resp
   if response == "more":
       msg2 = pamh.conversation(pamh.Message(pamh.PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON, "type somehting:"))
   pwd_msg = pamh.conversation(pamh.Message(pamh.PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF, "password:"))
   if pwd_msg.resp == "pw":
       return pamh.PAM_SUCCESS
   else:
       return pamh.PAM_AUTH_ERR
```


### Cookie-based workflows
Alternatively, the backend can send messages that are siliently stored on the iRODS client's "cookie" file.
These values can be send back to the client on demand.


#### Example
*/etc/pam.d/irods*
```bash
auth required pam_python.so /etc/pam.d/irods_complex.py
```


*/etc/pam.d/irods_complex.py*
```python
import json


def pam_sm_authenticate(pamh, flags, argv):
   # save a simple cookie on the client
   # display an optional message
   imsg = json.dumps({
       "patch": {"mykey": {"value": "myvalue"}},
       "echo": "the cookie 'mykey' has been updated"})
   pamh.conversation(pamh.Message(pamh.PAM_TEXT_INFO, imsg))


   # get a cookie from the client
   # don't bother user with this challenge
   imsg = json.dumps({
       "ask": "entry",
       "key": "counter"})
   msg = pamh.conversation(pamh.Message(pamh.PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON, imsg))
   counter = msg.resp
   with open("/out.txt", "w") as fp:
       fp.write("counter:{0}".format(counter))
   if not counter:
       counter = 0
   counter = int(counter) + 1
   imsg = json.dumps({
       "patch": {"counter": {"value": counter}}})
   pamh.conversation(pamh.Message(pamh.PAM_TEXT_INFO, imsg))


   # ask user for password
   imsg = json.dumps({
       "echo": "what is your password? ",
       "key": "password",
       "ask": "user"})
   pwd_msg = pamh.conversation(pamh.Message(pamh.PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF, imsg))
   if pwd_msg.resp == "pw":
       # second factor
       imsg = json.dumps({
           "echo": "what is your 2nd factor code? ",
           "key": "second",
           "ask": "user"})
       code_msg = pamh.conversation(pamh.Message(pamh.PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON, imsg))
       if code_msg.resp == "1234":
           imsg = json.dumps({"echo":
                              "number of logins: {0}".format(counter),
                              "context": "all"})
           # alternatives: "context": "iinit" (display message only for iinit command) (default)
           # alternatives: "context": "icommand" (display message only for other icommands)
           pamh.conversation(pamh.Message(pamh.PAM_TEXT_INFO, imsg))
           # alternatively:
           # pamh.conversation(pamh.Message(pamh.PAM_TEXT_INFO, "number of logins: {0}".format(counter)))
           return pamh.PAM_SUCCESS
   return pamh.PAM_AUTH_ERR
```
