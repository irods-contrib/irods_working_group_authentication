## Minutes

### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - First meeting since October 2020
 - Utrecht and SURF probably waiting for official inclusion
   - 4.2.9 won't include this work
     - 4-2-stable branch
   - 4.3.0 will have client-driven auth plugins (we have 4-5 to port)
     - master branch
     - By UGM2021 (June)
 - Utrecht using PAM Python plugin with OIDC to get MFA login on web portal
   - Still investigating (together with SURF) options to implement MFA on iCommands / webdav (davRods)
   - MFA handled at the OIDC layer, just a token to iRODS
 - Keycloak still to be investigated
 - Metalnx and OIDCâ€¦ is that possible/easy?
   - Using Spring security, could use existing plugins for OIDC
 - Future need to have iRODS reflect consistent users/groups from elsewhere
   - Currently available for Kerberos through distinguished user
   - Need more flexible approach (iadmin aua) for other authentication mechanisms
     - String based - attribute set on the user (metadata, or in user table)
     - OIDC email as token available via PAM - has to match (current workaround)
 - Will need to implement the client-side flow in both Java (Jargon) and Python (PRC)
   - Alongside master branch development
 - This authentication flow design has influenced the new iRODS CLI
   - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_cli 
   - Easier for client libraries to implement and maintain
