## Minutes

### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - Alan update
   - 4.3.0 has been released
   - KRB ported, but not shipped, could use the new flow if required
 - Stefan update
   - pam_interactive
     - now using PAM and then native with temporary password
     - avoids full PAM stack for each icommand (which is good)
     - working, much more readable
     - demo will work during the talk next week at UGM
   - Still had to update iinit to know/use pam_interactive
     - Stuck with this for now, will ship new logic in iinit in 4.3.1 
 - Discussion
   - TTL?  Less than 24h?
     - There is a deep assumption in the existing code limiting our ability to move to 'seconds' everywhere - the server was unhappy when the TTL was set 'too low' (the checks were 'out of order')
     - Temporary password vs. limited password
       - We're still not sure the difference/importance/reasoning
   - Other client libraries will need to learn about this new framework as well
 - Next Meeting
   - July 2022
