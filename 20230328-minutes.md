## Minutes

### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - pam_interactive
   - Alan: working in Stefan's repository, PR open, tweaks for building against 4.3.1pre and builder image to accept custom iRODS packages (pre-release)
     - Started a test suite for the pam_interactive plugin (similar to other plugins we release)
     - https://github.com/stefan-wolfsheimer/irods_auth_pam_interactive/pull/2 
     - Have started working to implement pam_password via pam_interactive
       - Possible future of ONLY pam_interactive... would have to be shown as backwards compatible
 - OIDC/oauth2 in REST C++ API
   - Martin: getting familiar with the specs/standards, expect/plan to handle the auth with OIDC
       - then continue to proxy the proven user via rodsadmin from API to iRODS server
     - Could alternatively send the oauth access token to the iRODS server and let the pam plugins authenticate/verify directly
       - no need for rodsadmin proxy
       - audit considerations are important
     - Definitely will be drawing diagrams for these flows
 - Keycloak integrations
   - Mike: iRODS DRS (GA4GH) working to get it part of the testing suite
     - To keep iRODS visible / relevant to the GA4GH community
     - https://github.com/michael-conway/irods-ga4gh-dos 
   - Harry: keycloak for testing, but stick to the standards for assumptions
 - Claudio: irods temporary password in irodsA file, related bug is two-weeks age of token
   - Conflicts with the temporary password (could go beyond the max two-week requirement)
   - Solution1: temporary could be very small... 1h?   2w is too long
     - Intended to be configurable... but bug is that it doesn't work quite right
     - https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/3742
     - https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/5096
   - Solution2: pam module could dynamically reset the password
     - When the token expires, automatically reset the temporary pam password
     - Might need a new issue to capture this
   - Issues: https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/iRODS+-+known+issues 
 - Next Meeting
   - April 2023
