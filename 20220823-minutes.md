## Minutes

### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - Harry update, SURF
   - SRAM handles team member enrollment / group management
     - and authentication
     - Stores public keys for each user
     - and .irods/irods_environment.json
     - Including pam_interactive as auth scheme
   - Containerized setup
     - https://github.com/HarryKodden/SRAM-iRODS-Showcase 
     - sync.py to sync new accounts from SRAM to containers (linux) and in the iRODS catalog, runs via crontab every minute
   - Policy document describing how sync.py behaves
     - For creation AND for deletion of iRODS accounts
       - Ownership of any leftover data (reverts to admins, etc.)
 - iRODS may eventually choose one of these user/group management solutions
 - https://github.com/HarryKodden/irods-ldap-sync 
   - Handles all groups from SRAM to iRODS
   - But not iRODS to SRAM, so should be turned off / controlled
 - Python PAM bridge...
   - Prototype in python... Is it safe enough to use in production?
   - Then ported to C for production use
 - Next steps
   - Once access token expires... Refresh token work, perhaps seamlessly
 - Next Meeting
   - Sept 2022
