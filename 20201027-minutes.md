### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION


 - Considerations around reconnection.   PAM gets temporary password.  KRB and GSI does not… will need to go back and check how it's reconnecting/reauthenticating.
 - UU considering OIDC, and how does the reauthentication/reconnection work?
 - Violent agreement that using tokens only… JWTs… or perhaps keycloak… is the future
 - OIDC via PAM (on the backend) is the current way for UU… would like to move to OIDC in the frontend
 - iRODS server would need to be the piece that authenticates to the OIDC system, or every client needs to learn how to speak OIDC… which is not unreasonable
   - Would mean there's an OIDC auth plugin for iRODS, iRODS server is a relying party (RP)
 - Reinvented OIDC...

   - 0 - iRODS Server must register within the IDP -  'application' within the IDP - gets an application ID and a shared secret token
   - 1 - client gets authorization code - IDP certifies this user X grants access to its attributes to server iRODS
   - 2 - client sends authorization code to iRODS server, iRODS confirms with IDP, and user is authenticated - iRODS server provides an access token (with a limited time) for reuse by the client without reauthenticating
   - 3 - client uses access token to request operation (api call) to iRODS server - if expired, then go back to step 2 to get new access token
   - client can request authorization code be revoked?
   - everything can be curl calls
   - limit use case for now to icommands/iinit
   - select possible IDPs, iRODS provides IDP URL, iRODS server awaits good token from client (from step 2)
   - step 3, icommand makes iRODS server API call with good access token
   - federated IDPs are a little more complicated, but adds perhaps another redirect for the user, but could be made seamless
   - does keycloak already do all this...  to be investigated

 - Report from SURF - all functionality moved into their new plugin - only thing required is a tweak to iinit to start the flow (which would be in a new release of iRODS, presumably).  We need to decide how to handle this… a new endpoint, alongside old… with preference for first and fallthrough to old… or same endpoint with naming conventions to determine flow.  Second option has fewer moving parts, but creates a namespace within the plugin names (not ideal).
