## Minutes

### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - New server-side function for verifying credentials without logging in
   - For native authentication, to be used alongside rc_switch_user (coming in 4.3.1)
   - Merged
 - OIDC/OAuth2 in HTTP API
   - Active PR - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_http_api/pull/75 
   - Options for handling errors
     - Currently planning to log a lot and return the error to the client
     - Anything else that needs to be done?   Should be done?  Nice to have?
     - Possibly additional loggers for OIDC vs 'main server'
   - Alternative user mapping plugins… using OIDC claim information at the moment
     - Could be a variable that is checked, rather than hard-coded name
     - Noticed the 'sub' doesn't change / persistent across logins
       - Could be in a static local file mapping
   - SURF has/had a configuration file that held the mapping
     - Static per-provider…
     - A little dynamic - could be regular expression match on names
     - Or per dept, etc.  due to what information comes back from OIDC provider
   - Planning new work around 'state' in the HTTP API
     - Going with UUID for now, unless better ideas / concerns 
   - Does the HTTP API / OIDC work affect the PAM interactive work in any way?
     - pam_password is a subset of pam_interactive
     - PAM (behind iRODS) cannot handle the web-friendly OIDC flows
     - An iRODS server could be set up with both, but a particular user probably will not see 'both'
   - Harry's ready to test it all out.
   - SURF - honoring a refresh token?  Not yet, will add to the list
     - Honoring a timeout/expiry time
     - Honoring a sidechannel logout
 - Next Meeting
   - Sept 2023
