### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - Alan Update
   - Effort for porting interactive PAM plugin: https://github.com/alanking/irods/commit/6215c5ccec82ae4cc308e9bc6f1a0e282f857583
   - Never attempted to build or run this, not sure that it would actually do anything
   - Not much progress made this month
   - Met with Stefan to discuss how to move this forward and he agreed to take a swing at porting the existing plugin to the latest iRODS release
 - Federation will require the existing/old/original PAM plugin to talk to older servers
 - PAM-password will be the port of the old code to the new framework
 - PAM-interactive (possibly also to be known as just PAM in the future) uses the new framework
   - Is plugin driven, aka could be multi-step, multi-factor
 - Mike - consider a client briefing, for large/major releases
   - Also Go/Python/Java...
   - Developer docs, as well as a planning meeting
