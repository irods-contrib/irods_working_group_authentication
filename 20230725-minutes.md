DISCUSSION

 - Have merged iinit improvements
   - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_icommands/pull/338
   - Added new prompts to iinit for 4.3.1
   - SSL and authentication scheme
   - Allows for setup of these items without touching the .json file manually *after* setup
   - Change: Will save environment file, even with a failed authentication
 - New server-side function for verifying credentials without logging in
   - For native authentication, to be used alongside rc_switch_user (coming in 4.3.1)
   - Improves performance for HTTP API
   - At UGM, showed auth, 133 requests/sec, much slower than other operations
   - No performance measurements yet, still WIP
 - OIDC/OAuth2 in HTTP API
   - Depends on HTTP API, which depends on iRODS 4.3.1
