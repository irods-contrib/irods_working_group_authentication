## Minutes

### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - Alan Update
   - Legacy PAM plugin ported to use new plugin framework
     - Perhaps start calling it 'pam_password'
     - Functions as a standalone plugin instead of having a special flow via iinit
   - Attempted port of SURF's "interactive PAM" auth plugin to new framework
     - Originally https://github.com/stefan-wolfsheimer/irods_auth_plugin_pam_interactive
     - Not sure if this builds/works, hoping for tutorial
 - Next Steps
   - JSON token on client side - to hold information coming from the PAM stack
   - Most complicated part was/is to implement the callback function in the flow when coming from the PAM stack, as part of the handshake conversation(?)
   - Hold diagrams alongside the code - figure out if they are consistent/true
   - Demonstrate example session from original presentation, to confirm flow is still consistent
   - Updated diagram, similar to current interactive series, but box-within-a-box
 - Proposed
   - Small hackathon - to be able to poke at the PAM backend, via python (no compiling)
   - auth_check_main.cpp - as a debugging program, good place to start too
   - Would not use the python backend for production, but good for testing/prototyping
     - Any kind of conversation, flexible
 - Question (Stefan)
   - Consider adding threadpool, to control the number of active sessions with PAM
 - Claudio
   - iinit currently creates .irodsA (which requires iexit to remove)
   - Need to think about removing the cookie/JSON file
   - Current code, if JSON is not present, then challenge again to recreate
     - No explicit logout in the codeâ€¦ yet
   - Question, should iexit also remove this JSON file?
     - Perhaps just another plugin operation (so for native, remove .irodsA file, for PAM, remove this JSON)
   - Similar flow for when the server invalidates/revokes a good token
     - And again for renewing/refreshing
 - Other iRODS client libraries would need to learn this flow as well
   - Python, Go, Jargon, etc. But also the clients that use them
     - Interaction with the user
   - b/c no longer just challenge/password, need to copy/paste any tokens, etc.
   - Only the server has to talk to the PAM stack itself
 - Stefan will find/share the JSON cookie patch with Alan
   - Perhaps https://github.com/stefan-wolfsheimer/irods_client_icommands/tree/interactive-pam 
 - Next Meeting
   - April 2022
