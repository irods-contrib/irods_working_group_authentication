## Minutes

### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - RENCI update
   - iinit - PR almost merged - will be in 4.3.1
   - C++ REST API needing PAM/OIDC
     - Not clear how to do this / tie it in with this WG conversation
     - pam_interactive 'assumes' a TTY is on the other end?
       - This is insufficient for a passthrough scenario like REST API
     - iinit (client) just calls client side plugin directly and assumes it returns a YES/NO
     - For REST API, REST API is the client… and needs to go back to the human for inputs… and it's not currently part of the flow
     - Client -> REST API -> iRODS
     - Access token 'as' bearer token on the REST->iRODS stage?
   - Success could be shown with REST API doing its own OIDC/OAuth dance
     - REST API could be 'fixed' 2FA (or whatever we decide)
     - Then passing authenticated token to iRODS, which would use the same system on the backend to 'know' this is legitimate
     - iRODS would then know 'who' was authenticated
   - Break up the problem
     - Browser to OAuth/OIDC/SAML, then
     - rodsadmin proxying the mapped/tokened user to iRODS
   - SURF - Focus on the protocols directly
     - The use particular implementations (keycloak) as confirmation
 - LRZ - Converting iinit to 4.3.0
   - Adding pam_password awareness to iinit: https://github.com/irods/irods_client_icommands/commit/77873e0568074b572c12e7df563142843aa22feb
   - Porting authentication plugins to new framework
     - Plugin framework/native: https://github.com/irods/irods/commit/35e3c9ee9d6112a8f1f3f5ce118997f2d6bb3259
     - pam_password: https://github.com/irods/irods/commit/419734e7f2f4ea8c851096460dce7f37908113f2 
     - Kerberos (unreleased): https://github.com/irods/irods_auth_plugin_kerberos/pull/54/commits/231c01401f8d73add3fe50bbd256a09e45fd300c
 - What if iRODS allowed mapping of arbitrary incoming tokens to known iRODS local accounts?
   - Would be generic to any kind of auth
   - Could get the mapping from an external source
     - Rather than keeping a local sync from AD/etc.
   - Could map multiple incoming accounts to map to single iRODS user
   - Could map single incoming account with attribute to different iRODS users
 - Could be one single pam_interactive plugin that knows multiple protocols/tokens
   - Single source of truth
 - Or multiple smaller pam_specific plugins, used in a cascade
   - Smaller maintenance profile/pressure
 - Mike/NIEHS - using keycloak to authenticate first, then use that token to talk to Jargon
   - Working on a keycloak plugin, to talk with the DRS REST API
 - Next Meeting
   - Feb 2023
