## Minutes

### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - OIDC/OAuth2 in HTTP API
   - Active PR - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_http_api/pull/75 
   - Nearly feature complete, PR is out of draft
   - State is now handled via UUID
   - User mapping initially looking at custom 'irods_username' claim from provider
     - Considering an irods scope here?
   - Alternative mapping will happen in a separate PR, perhaps after initial release
   - Refresh token in a separate PR, created a new issue
 - Considering deprecating temporary passwords
   - Have contacted Maastricht about their use of this via PHP(!) and now Python
   - Use case was WebDAV usage (web portal generates and shows temp password)
     - Need native auth b/c webdav doesn't know how to PAM
     - Maastricht is PAM/SSO everywhere else
   - rcGetTemporaryPassword and rcGetTemporaryPasswordForOther
   - Possible workaround/alternate use case is to use Limited Password
   - Add LimitedPassword implementation to PRC/Jargon
     - Rework TemporaryPassword to call LimitedPassword in the server
   - SURF says Davrods can use PAM
 - Next Meeting
   - Oct 2023
