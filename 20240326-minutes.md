## Minutes

### SUMMARY:

DISCUSSION

 - OIDC/OAuth2 in HTTP API
   - Released v0.3.0, March 15, 2024
     - Protected Resource mode
     - Confidential Client mode
     - Alternate User Mapping
   - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_http_api/releases/tag/0.3.0
   - Interested in community feedback about which mode is used
     - Could consider removing one of them
   - Claudio - SURF has clients/wrappers using PRC to talk to iRODS directly
     - Could see HTTP API as a replacement where it makes sense
 - pam_interactive
   - Investigating adding tests for a possible release
   - pam_python requires python2 - has not been updated since 2020
     - Will require a different approach for automated testing.
   - Tried configuring PAM as described in the docs, like one would for pam_password
     - getting to “not_authenticated” state, and exiting)
     - https://docs.irods.org/4.3.1/plugins/pluggable_authentication/#user-setup
     - Confirmed that this configuration authenticates using the pam_handshake_auth_check, separately from the plugin
     - Investigating difference of plugin vs pam_handshake_auth_check
   - Enabling/disabling SSL in the plugin is not working
   - This can be avoided by just using SSL all the time / manually but the plugin needs to enforce this before we release
   - Or we just yell loudly to the admin that the system is not SSL-enabled
   - Default is SSL - active option to disable SSL
   - https://github.com/irods/irods_auth_plugin_pam_interactive/issues/16 
 - Next Meeting
   - April 2024
